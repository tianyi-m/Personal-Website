<p>		I'm Tianyi, a junior math major and cs minor with linguistics and philosophy clusters at the University of Rochester. 
<br><br>	I have a wide interests, including computer music and visualization, algrorithm visualization, math and physics visualization, ML/DL and data science, web games, compiler, computer system, server, and software dev. Here are <a href="project.html">my finished/on-going projects</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inipop.code/">video demo portfolio of my past projects</a>, here are <a href="AndYetAnotherListOfProjectIdeas.html">my future projects</a>.
<br><br>	I also <a href="blog.html">write</a> about my projects and just life in general. Note that life blogs are generally written in Chinese because I feel like I am more articulate in Chinese when telling stories. <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google translate</a> is actually really good for helping with this. Besides that, I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inipop.snaps/">snap</a> photos and <a href="https://somafm.com/">listen</a> to musics like somafm (go support them!). 
<br><br>	If you are interested in collab, email tma8@u.rochester.edu. I check them on a daily basis.
