<h1>A Brand New Project Outline</h1>
<p>		So I have this brand new project idea that I am really excited about. I usually don't write down my project ideas, because there is nothing to write about usually and I somehow know that those idea won't stick around. But this one is different (although I do think everytime it will be different to be fair). I do have something to write down about it, and I do think that it integrates different parts of my passion and solves a problem that I care deeply about.

<br><br> So basically (I realized that I am starting every paragraph with a "so"...oh well), I want to build a digital emotional support dog. A cute dog that you grow with on your phone. It will ask you if you have had lunch, if you've taken your meds, and did you go to bed on time and had enough sleep. It will ask how you are doing, and listen about your problems. It will hear you, see you, and love you. It will provide you emotional support no matter what, but it will grow if you actually take care of yourself. So decomposing different functionalities, I am currently considering these features:

<br><br>1. It asks you basic questions about your well-being. If you answer positively on those questions, it will grow. If you constantly do good, it will congradulate you. If you don't, it will ask what happened and listen to you. 
<br><br>2. It does cute tricks with you or just wiggles and twirl around or something like that. It just be cute and adorable. It will also randomly feed you wholesome animal memes.
<br><br>3. YOU CAN WALK HIM/HER. So just take your phone for a walk and it will appear on your screen if you open up camera. You can take a picture. Or you can also take a selfie with it. It will have a record of your walks on google map like one of those running apps.
<br><br>4. You will have unlimited free accessories with the dog, like toys, houses and dresses. So you can decorate it whenever you want.
<br><br>5. You can set alarms to feed them. You don't need to though, it's just something to start and structure your day with if you like. 
<br><br>I guess I will also include a list of probable dog models that we are hoping to create:
